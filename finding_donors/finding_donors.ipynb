    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Decision Trees: **\n",
    "* Decision trees can apply to many binary decision classification problems and usually they are combined with other algorithms . Applications examples: choosing between two adverts to recommend to a user based on his features, estimating the gender of the person based on his interests, recommending flights based on the approximate average income of the person or the how much the individual used to pay for flights, recommending applications based on gender, age, interests or any yes-no application or as a second stage after Naive Bayes to detect spam e-mails.\n",
    "* Decision trees are intuitive in explaining as they are used internally by humans in almost every decision they make. It's easy to visualize and understand. Since decision trees search through the values of each category, decisoin trees can handle predictors without the need of dummy variables by applying more depth to the tree internal nodes for each feature. (Instead of resolving the decision of a feature in one node, the feature final decisoin will be extended to multiple parent-child nodes relative to the number of different categories in the feature) \n",
    "* Decision trees tend to overfit especially when using very deep trees and a low minimum number of points in a leaf.\n",
    "* The CharityML contains multiple categorical features .e.g education-level, relationship, sex ... and the outcome we seek is a binary classification (above 50k or below), that's where decision can come handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Methods AdaBoost: **\n",
    "* Boosting can be applied to many learning algorithms, so the applications can extend to any of the possible applicable weak learners algorithms, but Adaboost is used generally in conjuction with decision trees as the weak-learner, so adaboost application contains all the previously mentioned applications of decision trees. One real application is recommendation systems where users main interests can be given higher weight while boosting the weak learner to recommend more related ads.\n",
    "* Adaboost better optimizes decision trees to correctly classify them misclassified points from the previous step while learning, so it's generally better in terms of accuracy than regular decision trees, also chances of overfitting are less compared to regular decision trees.\n",
    "* Adaboost can overfit in case many trees are used as learning estimators.\n",
    "* As CharityML is a binary classification problem, adaboost used with decision trees can obtain better f-score as boosting will give more weight to the misclassified low f-score points in each interation to be classified in the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines: **\n",
    "* face detection by classifying image in term of two categories: face and non-face.\n",
    "* Support vector machines are good in separating complex data by applying different kernel functions that enable closely points in a dimension to a separate higher dimension hyperplane. Hence, SVM can separate the data well if there is a complex function between our predictors and outcome.\n",
    "* Compared to other learning algorithms, SVM generlly takes very long time to run irrespective of the kernel (some kernels take less time than others 'linear' less than 'poly'), taking in consideration the different kernel functions and other paramters for each kernel ('C', 'gamma' in case of 'rbf'), it might take too long for the whole process (an hour to several)\n",
    "* vector machines solves the problem for a global optimum instead of local one thereby generating a unique solution, hence it can perform well in terms of f-score since we seek high precision. "

    "**Answer: ** <br>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    " AdaBoost is a boosting algorithm that can be applied to many models for better optimization. First, we choose the model we want to use as our base model .e.g. Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, etc. This model has to be better at predicting the class of interest, \"individuals that earn more than 50k here in the census data\", than randomly guessing. The base model is usually called the weak learner maybe because it's used usually in a simple form without much tuning to the model paramter (sklearn refer to the weak learner as base_estimator); for example, we here use simple decision trees and split the data in a simple way .e.g. using one node \"if the individual is over 30 years old, then we predict him to earn more than 50k, and otherwise if he is less than 30 years old\" instead of using complex decision tree with multiple decision nodes \"if the individual's age is more than 30 and less than 50 and his occupation is in certain list of occupations and not in another list of occupations and his capital gain is above certain value X, then the individual earns more than 50k\", Such deep complex trees tend to overfit and that's one reason why it's avoided in the weak learner. Then, the weak learner is applied to the data set a number of iteration (n_estimators in sklearn). In each iteration, the model record its misclassified point and boost their weights (give a higher weight) in the next iteration so that they may be classified correctly in the next iteration. One way to boost the misclassified points is to multiply them by a number .e.g. if the misclassified point is multipled by say 2, then when the next decision tree classify points, it will consider that there is 2 points with same features instead of just one, then the region containing this point is more likely to be correctly classified. Plainly, if there is three points A, B, C, the first weak learner correctly classifed B, C and misclassified A, then the next weak learner would try harder to correctly classify A by considering points A, A, B, C when constructing the tree.<p>\n",
    "Finally, when finishing applying the weak learners through the n-iterations, the outcome of each learner is combined to give the final classification boundaries ( in sklearn there is learning_rate parameter that gives the weight of each weak learner in contributing to the combined final model). Combining weak learners classification results can be done in multiple ways. A very simplistic way is to classify according to the highest class count; in our example, suppose that individual A is classified to earn more than 50k by 30 weak learners and classified the opposite (earn less than 50k) by 60 weak learners, then the final classification of individual A is that he/she earns less than 50klby a margin of 30 weak learners. But this approach isn't practical as some of the weak learners perform better at classification than others, but both the poor and good weak learners contribute the same when combining their effects. Hence, we may weight every learner according to its performance using a weighting function, one way is to take the natural logarithm of #correct_classification / #incorrect_classification. In decision trees, we take this natural logarithm for points classified above 50k and the negative of this logarithm for points classified less than 50k; the advantage of this approach is that deceiving weak learners negative effect that misclassify more than correctly classify is neuteralized as the natural logarithm for a fraction is negative and the natural logarithm of an integer greater than 1 is positive. Then when classifying using Adaboost, we combine the weak learners decision trees by summing each learner weight for classifing the point and if the summed weights add up to a positive number, then the individual earns more than 50k, otherwise the individual earns less than 50k. Plainly speaking, imagine if we would like to rate a product and we brought 4 individuals to rate the product one is expert, the other three are common folk and let's say that two of the common folk disliked the product, but the expert and the other individual liked the product. The result is neuteralized by count 2 for 2, but since the expert opinion is more valued as he consider different aspects before giving his opinion, we can say that the product will probably do well since the expert opinion weight makes his group liking the product heavier on the scales.

Another thing, I chose only one of capital-gain and capital-loss relying that they are dependent, but in the selection here, both of them are chosen.\n",
    "* The visualiztion confirms my thoughts as Age is considered 2nd important feature, but I ranked it 1st (very close). capital-gain and hours-per-week take the same ranks in both selection, but in flipped order (3d became 4th and vice versa). Education-num is considered amonth the top five, but the least in this selection, but I ranked it 2nd and that's the biggest difference between the two selection orders after choosing Sex and excluding capital-loss."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

Hence, overvall the reduced features model is generally worse than the full features model.\n",
    "* Yes, since the margins are relatively small and considering real life situation where training model can need much much time and computing power, possibly abundance of fast costly memory (caches) and subsequently high cost in addition to work schedules and deadlines, absolutely I will go for the reduced model as long as the consequence isn't detrimental (in case of medical situations or high accuracy situations like for science and designing spaceships and its applications."
